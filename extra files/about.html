    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello...I'm Angie! I have many hobbies such as playing video games, making video games, 
        exploring outside, and art! I'm current a senior at MSU studying Information Science 
        and I aspire to continue my career in IT until I go to graduate school for my Masters 
        of Library and Information Science. My favorite show is currently The Amazing Digital 
        Circus and I am currently playing Hollow Knight: Silksong. I listen to Mitski, Car 
        Seat Headrest, and Radiohead.</p>
