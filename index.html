        <li>I've never actually seen a browser interpret a json file before. I was very surprised at how
             organized firefox presents json files. It almost looks like an IDE.</li>
        <li>I've seen firefox present pdf files many time for school, but it was a bit surreal to see a 
            file I made get shown the same way</li>
        <li>I don't see txt files get presented often in a browser and it was shockingly similar to when 
            notepad opens them up in Windows. I wasn't exactly not expecting it, but a json file which 
            almost just text looks so much more organized and utilized.</li>
